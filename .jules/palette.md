## 2025-05-20 - Standardizing Touch Targets with UI Components

**Context:** The Reader View toolbar used raw HTML `<button>` elements with inconsistent styling and small touch targets (often effectively 36px or dependent on padding).

**Learning:**
- Replacing raw buttons with the design system's `Button` component (`size="icon"`) standardizes the touch target to 40px, which is closer to the 44px mobile target recommendation.
- It automatically provides accessible focus rings and keyboard interaction states.
- Visual consistency (e.g., `rounded-full`) can be maintained via `className` overrides on the standard component, allowing us to keep the design intent while improving UX and accessibility.
