# PRD: Device-Optimized Experiences

**Status:** Draft | **Priority:** Major | **Category:** UX

## 1. Problem Statement

One UI doesn't fit all devices:
- Phone: One-handed, small targets
- Tablet: Two-handed, reading focus
- Desktop: Mouse, multi-window
- Car: Large buttons, voice
- Watch: Minimal, controls only

Currently, same UI everywhere = suboptimal everywhere.

## 2. Vision

**Right experience for right device**:
- Phone: Immersive reading, easy TTS access
- Tablet: Split-view, annotation sidebar
- Desktop: Library management, bulk operations
- Car Mode: Giant buttons, voice commands
- Watch: Play/pause, skip, basic controls

## 3. Device Profiles

| Device | Primary Use | Secondary Use |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Phone | TTS listening | Quick reading |
| Tablet | Deep reading | Annotations |
| Desktop | Library mgmt | Reading |
| Car | TTS only | — |
| Watch | TTS controls | Progress check |

## 4. Proposed Features

### P0 (MVP)
- [ ] Responsive layouts (phone/tablet breakpoints)
- [ ] Car mode (manual or auto-detect)
- [ ] Desktop-optimized library view

### P1 (Enhancement)
- [ ] Tablet annotation sidebar
- [ ] Watch companion app
- [ ] Voice commands everywhere

### P2 (Delight)
- [ ] Desktop keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] iPad Pencil support
- [ ] External display support

## 5. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| UI satisfaction per device | >4/5 |
| Car mode adoption | 15% of TTS users |
| Tablet reading time | +20% |
