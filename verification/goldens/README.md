# Golden Screenshots

This directory contains the "golden" reference screenshots for the visual verification suite. These images represent the validated, expected state of the application's UI for specific user journeys.

When running tests, new screenshots are compared against these files. If they match (within a threshold), the test passes. If they differ, the test fails, indicating a potential visual regression.
